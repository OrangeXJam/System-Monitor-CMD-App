## Important Notice

- The only fully working version currently is the **Linux native version**.  
- To use it, you need a **native Linux installation** (VMs will not work).  
- The Windows and macOS versions may show missing data values due to restrictions when running inside virtual containers.  
- This may be fixed in a future release if the project is updated.
